        <h2>SOME FACTS ABOUT ARMY STEW (BUDAE JJIGAE)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Army stew or army base stew (Budae Jjigae) is Korean fusion stew that incorporates American style processed food such as spam, sausages, canned baked beans and sliced cheese.</li>
          <li>Budae (부대) is a general term for a military base in Korean and Jjigae (찌개) is a term for soup/stew. Hence the word army stew or army base stew was born.</li>
          <li>Soon after the Korean war (in the early 1950’s), food was extremely scarce in Korea, so those surplus processed foods from the US military bases were a great supplement for Koreans.</li>
          <li>Among the US military base areas in Korea, Uijeongbu, an hour north of Seoul, is most famous for this stew.</li>
