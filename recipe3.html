          <p>Ingredients</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Korean Rice Cakes</li>
            <li>Anchovy stock packets</li>
            <li>Gochujang</li>
            <li>Korean red pepper flakes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Instructions</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Start by making the tteokbokki sauce. Mix the gochujang (Korean red pepper paste), gochugaru (Korean red pepper powder), soy sauce, garlic, and sugar in a small bowl and let the flavors combine.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile add the anchovy stock packet and water to a large, deep pan and bring it to a boil. Once it boils, remove the stock packet and add the red pepper paste. If you don't have the anchovy stock packet, just bring water or any stock to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once the tteokbokki sauce comes to a boil, add in the rice cakes, fish cakes, and any vegetables. Boil for about 5 to 7 minutes or until soft and tender.</li>
            <li>The sauce should thicken and reduce as the rice cakes soften and become chewy.</li>
            <li>Next, add optional ingredients such as hard boiled eggs, ramen noodles, pre-cooked dumplings (mandu), or shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Finally, add toasted sesame oil, scallions, sesame seeds.</li>
          </ol>
